# Vimrc  
This minimal Vim configuration is my personal favorite, and I highly recommend it for those who share similar interests. Feel free to adopt it if it aligns with your preferences!

## How to use
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nubiv/vimrc/main/vimrc_setup.sh | sh
```

## Enjoy :)
